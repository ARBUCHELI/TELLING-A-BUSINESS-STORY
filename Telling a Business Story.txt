* Why we tell stories
---------------------
Whether you're selling a product online or explaining a concept to colleagues, one of the best ways to get your message across is through a story.

Storytelling is second nature to us. We tell stories – and listen to them – every day. It's how we learn, teach, communicate, entertain, and understand.

And in business too, there are real benefits to using storytelling to communicate information.

Why is storytelling such an effective way of transmitting information?

	. One reason is that storytelling engages every part of the human brain. Unlike a non-narrative presentation, a well-told story speaks to both the left and right sides of the brain.
Hence, the listener can process an event and analyze it at the same time. It's because storytelling is such a natural human process.

	. Another reason is that storytelling fosters deeper connections between people, which ultimately builds empathetic relationships with the audience. In contrast to a standard, 
	formulaic presentation of information, an engaging story fosters a sense of camaraderie and shared experience.

For example, you've probably seen how sharing stories between team members is a great way to build team spirit and empathy. Suppose with a team project well-underway, you discover that 
the requirements are suddenly changing, negating several months' worth of work. Sharing a story of a previous project in which a similar abrupt change of direction ultimately led to a 
greater level of project and company success, can help foster empathic connections and facilitate understanding and mutual support, which in turn mitigates against the potential for 
frustration and anger.

And that brings us to the next reason why storytelling is so effective at communicating information:

	. it engages the listener on multiple levels. Notice how engaged listeners lean forward when listening to a story. That's because a good story engages us fully:
	physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

Appealing to a listener's emotions makes any story more memorable. And finally, storytelling is an effective way of transmitting information because it increases the perceived value of 
the subject.

	. Storytelling can be particularly useful in sales, for instance. Telling an interesting story about a product makes customers more inclined to buy it.

An engaging narrative is often one of the deciding factor swhen people buy a product or service.

For example, look at how life insurance is marketed:a story or narrative is presented about how insurance protects families and loved ones. A story about something we care about is used 
to get us to think about a product we'd really rather not think about. And then we buy it.

	. Ultimately, when you connect a business objective to a story, the perceived value and appeal of the product increases.

Storytelling isn't limited to generating sales, of course.

It can be used in project management, training, customer service, planning, and virtually any other area.

It's a valuable tool for most any business practice.

Stories connect us. It's not as simple as "once upon a time."

Using effective storytelling within a business context takes some preparation and practice. It takes effort. But it's worth it.

Instead of merely relaying facts, telling a story makes things memorable, understandable, compelling, and relatable. And more than anything, it engages the listener.

* Elements of Effective Stories
-------------------------------
People are exposed to stories all the time. They're everywhere – and even more so since the advent of the Internet and social media.

To be heard above the multitude, you need to make your stories stand out from the crowd. And you can do that by ensuring your stories have all the necessary elements of effective business 
storytelling.

Specifically, there are four elements that work in concert to make a business story effective.

	. The first element is relatability. People are more comfortable with things that they know –things they can relate to. It follows then that your audience will be more engaged with a 
story that features familiar things – a setting or a character they know and can identify with.

If your content requires presenting new ideas or context, find familiar analogies to use or ways to compare it to common examples. Relatability is the secret to truly engaging audiences.

	. Seemingly conversely, the next element is novelty. While familiarity is good up to a point, and audiences love characters they recognize, repeating the same narrative or 
	storyline over and over gets old and tends to make an audience tune out.

New stories, or novel variations on a familiar theme, are more engaging for an audience than ones they've already heard.

A new story is naturally more interesting.

It refocuses attention and draws the audience back in.

	. Another element of effective storytelling is tension. A sense of tension in your story will draw your audience in –you can see it in their physical reaction when they lean 
forward, concentrating,focused and engaged, anxious to find out how the problem will be resolved.

They want to know, need to know, what's going to happen next. But it's a balancing act.

You want enough tension to attract and draw in your audience, but not too much tension.

Too much tension pushes people away.

It takes practice to get it right.

	. The final element is ease of understanding. It's important to keep the language and plot simple so that the story is ultimately easy to understand.

The audience won't be engaged if it's struggling to understand exactly what's at stake or what's going on.

Don't put barriers in the way of the audience getting involved and engrossed.

Make it easy for them. And when necessary, tailor the story to your audience.

Experts and novices are very different audiences, and don't forget that experts in topic A may be novices in topic B. Storytelling is a powerful, compelling, and engaging way of 
getting your message across and connecting with your audience. And your business storytelling effort needs to hit the mark. And that means storytelling that has relatability, novelty,
tension, and ease of understanding.

* Know Your Audience
--------------------
Every story needs an audience –there's no point to a great story if no one ever hears it. To maximize the impact of your story, you need to identify the right audience and then create a 
connection with them.

While this is easier said than done, there are four specific actions you can take to create a connection with your audience. In a business context, your audience will generally be defined 
for you, based on the business need that's being met by your story.

They might be stakeholders whose approval you need to jump-start a project. 

They might be clients you need to persuade to take action on an initiative. 

They might be coworkers you need to convince of the need for a new business process.

	. Whatever the case, the first action is to profile the target audience.

You need to know and really understand your target audience. Marketers might ask, 

what's the company's ideal customer?

What do they like and dislike?

What are their habits?

Opinions?

Priorities?

When and how do they get their information?

Conversely, the audience might be a new cross-functional project team filled with specialists from many functional areas.

Or maybe a group of experts in one particular field.

In all cases, you need to know who they are and what they want and need to know.

Let these details guide and direct your storytelling because these people are your target audience.

Once you've done this, you can then begin to match your message to the target audience.

Don't try to create a generic story that will appeal to everyone.

It's impossible.

In fact, do the opposite.

Tailor the story to appeal directly to your target audience.

Match the story to their preferences, habits, needs, and prior knowledge.

A group of web developers don't need to be told how a multi-page responsive website works, but the sales team might.

Your audience is all that matters.

This includes internal, external, and business-to-business audiences.

Whoever they are, that's who they are.

The next action is to create details and a narrative to use stories to connect more deeply with that audience.

Stories have the power to create real, genuine connections between the storyteller and the audience in a way that statistics, straight facts, or product features struggle to create.

Stories are simply more engaging.

And that's what your audience wants: to be engaged.

Draw your audience in with a story –don't push it away with a simple, dry recitation of facts and statistics.

Engage them in your story, putting a face and narrative to those facts and stats and you build a connection deeper and more meaningful than a list of product features or attributes could 
ever hope to achieve.

The final action is to use the audience's own words.

How the story is told can be as important as the story itself.

That means telling the story in a way your audience understands and can relate to – or telling it in their own words, using their own language, terminology, and vocabulary.

Using their words will draw them in and connect them to you.

This often means, of course, having different versions of the same story for different audiences.

If you're telling the story to a group of accountants, it's okay to use their financial jargon –but if you're telling the story to a tech audience, leave out the debt-service coverage 
ratio, but it's fine to drop in a DHCP.

Ultimately, for your business story to resonate and have a genuine impact, you need to first know and understand your audience.

Then you can dovetail your message, your story, with their needs.
