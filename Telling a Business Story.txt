* Why we tell stories
---------------------
Whether you're selling a product online or explaining a concept to colleagues, one of the best ways to get your message across is through a story.

Storytelling is second nature to us. We tell stories – and listen to them – every day. It's how we learn, teach, communicate, entertain, and understand.

And in business too, there are real benefits to using storytelling to communicate information.

Why is storytelling such an effective way of transmitting information?

	. One reason is that storytelling engages every part of the human brain. Unlike a non-narrative presentation, a well-told story speaks to both the left and right sides of the brain.
Hence, the listener can process an event and analyze it at the same time. It's because storytelling is such a natural human process.

	. Another reason is that storytelling fosters deeper connections between people, which ultimately builds empathetic relationships with the audience. In contrast to a standard, 
	formulaic presentation of information, an engaging story fosters a sense of camaraderie and shared experience.

For example, you've probably seen how sharing stories between team members is a great way to build team spirit and empathy. Suppose with a team project well-underway, you discover that 
the requirements are suddenly changing, negating several months' worth of work. Sharing a story of a previous project in which a similar abrupt change of direction ultimately led to a 
greater level of project and company success, can help foster empathic connections and facilitate understanding and mutual support, which in turn mitigates against the potential for 
frustration and anger.

And that brings us to the next reason why storytelling is so effective at communicating information:

	. it engages the listener on multiple levels. Notice how engaged listeners lean forward when listening to a story. That's because a good story engages us fully:
	physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

Appealing to a listener's emotions makes any story more memorable. And finally, storytelling is an effective way of transmitting information because it increases the perceived value of 
the subject.

	. Storytelling can be particularly useful in sales, for instance. Telling an interesting story about a product makes customers more inclined to buy it.

An engaging narrative is often one of the deciding factor swhen people buy a product or service.

For example, look at how life insurance is marketed:a story or narrative is presented about how insurance protects families and loved ones. A story about something we care about is used 
to get us to think about a product we'd really rather not think about. And then we buy it.

	. Ultimately, when you connect a business objective to a story, the perceived value and appeal of the product increases.

Storytelling isn't limited to generating sales, of course.

It can be used in project management, training, customer service, planning, and virtually any other area.

It's a valuable tool for most any business practice.

Stories connect us. It's not as simple as "once upon a time."

Using effective storytelling within a business context takes some preparation and practice. It takes effort. But it's worth it.

Instead of merely relaying facts, telling a story makes things memorable, understandable, compelling, and relatable. And more than anything, it engages the listener.

* Elements of Effective Stories
-------------------------------
People are exposed to stories all the time. They're everywhere – and even more so since the advent of the Internet and social media.

To be heard above the multitude, you need to make your stories stand out from the crowd. And you can do that by ensuring your stories have all the necessary elements of effective business 
storytelling.

Specifically, there are four elements that work in concert to make a business story effective.

	. The first element is relatability. People are more comfortable with things that they know –things they can relate to. It follows then that your audience will be more engaged with a 
story that features familiar things – a setting or a character they know and can identify with.

If your content requires presenting new ideas or context, find familiar analogies to use or ways to compare it to common examples. Relatability is the secret to truly engaging audiences.

	. Seemingly conversely, the next element is novelty. While familiarity is good up to a point, and audiences love characters they recognize, repeating the same narrative or 
	storyline over and over gets old and tends to make an audience tune out.

New stories, or novel variations on a familiar theme, are more engaging for an audience than ones they've already heard.

A new story is naturally more interesting.

It refocuses attention and draws the audience back in.

	. Another element of effective storytelling is tension. A sense of tension in your story will draw your audience in –you can see it in their physical reaction when they lean 
forward, concentrating,focused and engaged, anxious to find out how the problem will be resolved.

They want to know, need to know, what's going to happen next. But it's a balancing act.

You want enough tension to attract and draw in your audience, but not too much tension.

Too much tension pushes people away.

It takes practice to get it right.

	. The final element is ease of understanding. It's important to keep the language and plot simple so that the story is ultimately easy to understand.

The audience won't be engaged if it's struggling to understand exactly what's at stake or what's going on.

Don't put barriers in the way of the audience getting involved and engrossed.

Make it easy for them. And when necessary, tailor the story to your audience.

Experts and novices are very different audiences, and don't forget that experts in topic A may be novices in topic B. Storytelling is a powerful, compelling, and engaging way of 
getting your message across and connecting with your audience. And your business storytelling effort needs to hit the mark. And that means storytelling that has relatability, novelty,
tension, and ease of understanding.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Know Your Audience
--------------------
Every story needs an audience –there's no point to a great story if no one ever hears it. To maximize the impact of your story, you need to identify the right audience and then create a 
connection with them.

While this is easier said than done, there are four specific actions you can take to create a connection with your audience. In a business context, your audience will generally be defined 
for you, based on the business need that's being met by your story.

They might be stakeholders whose approval you need to jump-start a project. 

They might be clients you need to persuade to take action on an initiative. 

They might be coworkers you need to convince of the need for a new business process.

	. Whatever the case, the first action is to profile the target audience.

You need to know and really understand your target audience. Marketers might ask, 

what's the company's ideal customer?

What do they like and dislike?

What are their habits?

Opinions?

Priorities?

When and how do they get their information?

Conversely, the audience might be a new cross-functional project team filled with specialists from many functional areas.

Or maybe a group of experts in one particular field.

In all cases, you need to know who they are and what they want and need to know.

Let these details guide and direct your storytelling because these people are your target audience.

Once you've done this, you can then begin to match your message to the target audience.

Don't try to create a generic story that will appeal to everyone.

It's impossible.

In fact, do the opposite.

Tailor the story to appeal directly to your target audience.

Match the story to their preferences, habits, needs, and prior knowledge.

A group of web developers don't need to be told how a multi-page responsive website works, but the sales team might.

Your audience is all that matters.

This includes internal, external, and business-to-business audiences.

Whoever they are, that's who they are.

	. The next action is to create details and a narrative to use stories to connect more deeply with that audience.

Stories have the power to create real, genuine connections between the storyteller and the audience in a way that statistics, straight facts, or product features struggle to create.

Stories are simply more engaging.

And that's what your audience wants: to be engaged.

Draw your audience in with a story –don't push it away with a simple, dry recitation of facts and statistics.

Engage them in your story, putting a face and narrative to those facts and stats and you build a connection deeper and more meaningful than a list of product features or attributes could 
ever hope to achieve.

	. The final action is to use the audience's own words.

How the story is told can be as important as the story itself.

That means telling the story in a way your audience understands and can relate to – or telling it in their own words, using their own language, terminology, and vocabulary.

Using their words will draw them in and connect them to you.

This often means, of course, having different versions of the same story for different audiences.

If you're telling the story to a group of accountants, it's okay to use their financial jargon –but if you're telling the story to a tech audience, leave out the debt-service coverage 
ratio, but it's fine to drop in a DHCP.

Ultimately, for your business story to resonate and have a genuine impact, you need to first know and understand your audience.

Then you can dove tail your message, your story, with their needs.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Plotting Your Story
---------------------
Every story needs a plot. You can't just jump in without a clear goal, interesting ideas, believable characters, and a moral.

And that's why it's so important to plan your story.

And the initial planning stages are especially important.

Fortunately, there are some key strategies for the initial stages of planning a story.

	. The first key strategy is to set goals for the story. 
		. What's the point of your storytelling effort?
		. What are you trying to achieve?
	
		You need to understand what gap your story will fill, what connection it will make. 

		. Why are you telling the story in the first place? 
		. Are you trying to sell something?
		. Are you trying to sway someone's opinion?
		. What's the point?

	. Once you've figured this out, you need to decide how you can best tell your story.
		. Should you go for humor or pathos?			
		. Do you want your audience to laugh or cry?
		. And what's your format?
		. Are you talking in front of a whiteboard or shooting a video?

These matter in making your point.

	. Next, brainstorm ideas.
		. Perhaps you already have some rough or vague ideas, but outside input helps.
		. Brainstorming can bring out aspects of a story that you have overlooked or missed.
		. It's better to have lots of ideas than just a few –you can whittle things down later.
		. Be sure, though, not to lose focus – so keep the goal and the audience in mind.

Once you've decided on your idea, iron out the details. Have a clear story pitch. Outline the hero, the plot, and moral of the story. It's your story – sell it.

	. The next strategy is to create characters. Every story needs a hero – a main character. The hero – or main character – delivers the message of the story.
		. Your story can have as many characters as necessary, but don't go overboard.
		. Get rid of any unnecessary characters, and make sure they're distinct and that the audience understands what makes them tick.
		. And most of all, keep them believable.

Never forget that your hero represents your message, your company,your brand, your product. The hero doesn't have to wear a logo or anything too obvious, but do ensure that the hero 
represents or embodies the qualities of the brand or product.

	. The final strategy is to identify the moral.
		. It's just that: what's the moral of the story?
		. What do you want the audience to take from the story?

That's the value judgment about your brand or product you want the audience to make.

There's a balancing act here: on the one hand, you want the moral to be clear enough that everyone gets it, but subtle enough that the audience doesn't feel judged or talked down to.

They should be able to discern the moral on their own.

One last thing to note: when you're figuring out the moral of the story, keep the audience in mind. Make sure it's compatible with their feelings of right and wrong, for instance. In every
aspect of business, planning is crucial. And effective business storytelling is no exception. Before you take your story anywhere, you need to know where you want it to go.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Structuring Your Story
------------------------
A story that lacks direction or shape, one that fizzles out before the end, is a story that's not going to serve its business purpose.

That's why it's so important to properly structure your story –to take it from point A to point Z smoothly and effectively.

This means clearly outlining your story's beginning, the middle, and the end. And for that, there are some useful strategies. When looking to effectively structure your story, 

	. the first strategy is to determine the key message.

		Essentially, it's the fundamental point of the story. And it comes out of the theme. For example, if the theme is fiscal responsibility, the key message might be the 
		importance of keeping tight control over costs.

		The key message is how you want your audience to act or react in response to the theme.

		Your key message should be a concise sentence that's clear, positive, and memorable.

		And be sure to refer to it as you build your story to ensure you stay on track.

	. The next strategy is to plan the plot and the narrative arc.

		The plot is the series of events leading from A to Z.

		It's the path the character takes to get to the moral of the story.

		The narrative arc is the flow of how the situation unfolds along the way.

		The simplest way to build a story is using a three-act structure

			. act one is the beginning, 
			. act two is the middle, 
			. and act three is the end.

		Every act bolsters some aspect of the key message.

	. The third strategy is to plan the central conflict. The central conflict – sometimes called the core conflict – is the substance or meat of the story.

		It usually happens in act two of your story, which is where the main conflict comes into play.

		Here, you describe the conflict, the impact it has on the main character, and what's needed to overcome it.
	
		The tension that results from conflict maintains your audience's interest and keeps them engaged, so it's important to plan this section carefully. And then in the next 
		act, the character steps up and overcomes the problem.

		That's where the key message is delivered or reinforced, showing the audience how to apply the lesson learned: maybe it's finding the courage to slay the dragon; maybe it's
 		researching sound investments or buying the right toothpaste.

	. And the final strategy for structuring your story is to create an outline. The outline is where you sketch out the key details and lay out their context and flow.

		Outline the opening, the conflict, the barriers, and the resolution.

		Ensure that there's a clear main character and that other characters are named.

		List each act, the important events, and the specific story details.

		When you've done all this, you're ready to write.

		Don't worry too much at this stage about getting everything captured perfectly. Just get it all on paper. Then you can read it and consider the themes and if the story is 
		structured effectively.

		Is anything missing?

		What needs more detail?

		What needs less?

		Is it coherent and does it make sense?

		The outline is your roadmap, leading your story, and your audience, on its journey from beginning to end.

When we hear a great story, we don't always – or even often –give any thought to the planning and structuring that went into it. But every great story has been carefully plotted out.

And your business story deserves no less effort.

* Telling Your Story
--------------------
You have a killer business story to tell. You know the audience. You've plotted it out in detail. And you've worked out the structure. You're almost there...but not quite.

There's still that one big step remaining.

You still need to write and present it .And that's when strategies for effectively drafting and presenting business stories come into play.

	. It seems obvious, but the first step is to write and edit a draft of the story.

		The purpose of writing is clear, but editing and rewriting allow you to polish the story, smooth out the rough edges, and refine the action.

		It's about stripping out everything that doesn't need to be there. When you're writing, remember, though, that telling a story isn't the same as just recounting the facts 
		of a situation or event.

		You need to create interest and engagement.

		That means creating a world for your audience to explore.

		Let them know what it looks and sounds and feels like.

		And let them know the characters – how they think and feel about their world, where the conflict and tension comes from.

		Most importantly, everything in your story should serve a purpose.

		If it doesn't, either cut it or change it.

		Keep the focus on your themes and key messages. And when you've written and edited...do it all again.


	. Next, practice your presentation, making note of any issues. As the old saying goes, practice makes perfect.

		When you've finished writing, read the story aloud – first to yourself and then to someone else.

		How does that come across?

		Is your message clear?

		Make a note of any issues, anything that doesn't sound quite right, or anything that doesn't quite work.

		You need to find the right balance between being spontaneous and over-preparing.

		If you over-practice, you risk coming across as flat, like you're just reciting from memory.

		On the other hand, if you're underprepared, you risk sounding unfocused and unclear.

	. The third strategy is to make your presentation engaging. The way you deliver or present your story matters a lot –and we're talking about both the style and the method.

		Always keep the audience and goal in mind. There are certain tones that will turn an audience off. Don't be arrogant, don't vent about bad customers, and don't trash-talk 
		your competitors.

		Stay upbeat.If you're addressing a negative, keep the focus back on your positive solution or alternative.

		And make the story memorable.

		If it's appropriate, use humor and surprise to your advantage.

		If you're presenting verbally, use voices and body language to bring your characters to life.

		Then get your story out there. If you're telling it in-person to a live audience, record it so that you can share it later with others.

		An engaging story will get shared and retold, reaching an expanding audience.

	. And finally, make note of any lessons learned and adjust.

		Delivering or presenting your story isn't the end.

		It's time to take stock, learn lessons, and, if necessary, make some changes.

		It's easy to know if you've bombed: no one laughs; applause is polite, at best; attention wanders.

		Success is the opposite.

		If the audience responds the way you hoped, you've likely done well.

		But even then, there's always room for improvement.
	
		It's important to review what worked and what didn't.

		For immediate feedback, ask your audience.

		If you've presented something online, watch for online reviews and comments.

		Based on the feedback you get, you may need to make further adjustments or remove some parts completely.

		Learn your lessons and apply them.
